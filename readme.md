The project plans a risk early warning scheme for the debt default risk of urban investment platform.

On the basis of theoretical analysis, an indicator system for evaluating the default risk of urban investment bonds is established,
and an early warning model is established based on comprehensive evaluation indicators and ratings.

When establishing the early warning model, multiple deep learning algorithms with complex network structures and integrated learning ideas are introduced to form multiple early warning schemes.

Through comparison of prediction accuracy, this paper explores which kind of algorithm has more advantages in prediction in the field of target problem in the face of such data sets with shorter time length and more index dimensions.

Finally, it proposes that the most suitable early warning method is the integrated learning method with three deep learning methods as the sub learning machine.
